# Nitrogen

Nitrogen is an interpreted programming language written in Go. It's the product of [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). It uses the book's interpreter as a base and then builds on it to make a more full featured language.

**NOTE:** This interpreter is **NOT** intended for production purposes. It's purely educational. Feel free to use it for personal scripts and what not. But if this is used in a production environment, you're on your own.
